# EmployeeManagement
## This is a learning project to practice the MVC design pattern with ASP.NET Core
In this project I am tryring to implement a ASP .Net core web application to manage employees. My resource for this task is the youtube channel [KudVenkat](https://www.youtube.com/c/Csharp-video-tutorialsBlogspot).
Currently I am following the instructions and steps as told in [ASP NET Core Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhVkdrusLaQsfERmL_Jh4XmU).
